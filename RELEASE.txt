A new SCons release, 4.2.0, is now available
on the SCons download page:

      https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.2.0:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- Ninja - Added ninja API 'NINJA_FORCE_SCONS_BUILD' to force a node to callback to scons.

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- Ninja - Expanded ninja Mkdir to also support Mkdir actions.
- Further PCH updates. It's now recommended that env['PCH'] should always be a File node.
  Either via return value from env.PCH() or by explicitly using File('StdAfx.pch').
- Change SCons.Platform.win32.get_architecture() to return platform.platform() when run in an
  environment where neither: PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 nor PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE is set.
  This should fix platform tests which started failing when HOST_OS/HOST_ARCH changes
  introduced by Aaron Franke (listed below) were merged.

FIXES
-----

- Fix reproducible builds. Restore logic respecting SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH when set.
- Small fix to ensure CLVar default value is an empty list.
  See MongoDB bug report: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-59656
  Code contributed by MongoDB.
- Ninja - Fix ninja tool to never use for_sig substitution because ninja does not use signatures. This
  issue affected CommandGeneratorAction function actions specifically.
- Fix PCH not being evaluated by subst() where necessary.
- Fix issue #4021.  Change the way subst() is used in Textfile() to not evaluate '$$(' -> '$',
  but instead it should yield '$('.
- Ninja - Fix command line escaping for ninja dollar sign escape. Without escaping ninja properly,
  the ninja file scons regenerate and callback invocations will lose the $ characters used in
  the scons command line which ninja uses itself for escaping. For Example:
      scons BUILD=xyz OTHERVAR=$BUILD
  Prior to this fix, it would cause ninja to fail to escape the dollar sign, leading to the 
  single dollar sign being used as a ninja escape character in the ninja file.
- Ninja - Fixed an issue where if you control-c and/or killed ninja while it was running scons to regenerate
  build.ninja you would end up with no build.ninja file and have to rerun scons from scratch.
  Code contributed by MongoDB.
