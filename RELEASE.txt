A new SCons release, 4.1.0, is now available
on the SCons download page:

      https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.1.0:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- List new features (presumably why a checkpoint is being released)

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

    - SCons now supports the command-line parameter `--hash-format` to override the default
      hash format that SCons uses. It can also be set via `SetOption('hash_format')`. Supported
      values are: `md5`, `sha1`, and `sha256`. For all hash formats other than
      the default of `md5`, the SConsign database will include the name of the hash format.
      For example, `--hash-format=sha256` will create a SConsign with name
      `.sconsign_sha256.dblite.`.
    - Improve Subst()'s logic to check for proper callable function or class's argument list.
      It will now allow callables with expected args, and any extra args as long as they
      have default arguments. Additionally functions with no defaults for extra arguments
      as long as they are set using functools.partial to create a new callable which set them.

FIXES
-----

    - The command-line parameter `--md5-chunksize` is now deprecated. Use `--hash-chunksize`
      instead.


IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- List improvements that wouldn't be visible to the user in the
  documentation:  performance improvements (describe the circumstances
  under which they would be observed), or major code cleanups

PACKAGING
---------

- List changes in the way SCons is packaged and/or released

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- List any significant changes to the documentation (not individual
  typo fixes, even if they're mentioned in src/CHANGES.txt to give
  the contributor credit)

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- List visible changes in the way SCons is developed
