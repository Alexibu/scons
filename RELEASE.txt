Here is a summary of the changes since 4.5.0:

FIXES
-----

- Fix a problem in 4.5.0 where using something like the following code
  will cause a Clone()'d environment to share the CPPDEFINES with the
  original Environment() which was cloned. Causing leakage of changes
  to CPPDEFINES when they should be completely independent after the Clone.
      env=Environment(CPPDEFINES=['a'])
      env.Append(CPPDEFINES=['b']) (or AppendUnique,Prepend,PrependUnique)
      env1=env.Clone()
      env1.Append(CPPDEFINES=['c']) (or any other modification, but not overwriting CPPDEFINES)
  Now env['CPPDEFINES'] will contain 'c' when it should not.
