A new SCons release, 4.2.0, is now available
on the SCons download page:

      https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.2.0:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- Add support for Visual Studio 2022.
- Add support for pre-release versions of Visual Studio 2022 via an environment variable.
- Added ninja API 'NINJA_FORCE_SCONS_BUILD' to force a node to callback to scons.

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- Expanded ninja Mkdir to also support Mkdir actions.
- Further PCH updates. It's now recommended that env['PCH'] should always be a File node.
  Either via return value from env.PCH() or by explicitly using File('StdAfx.pch').
- Change SCons.Platform.win32.get_architecture() to return platform.platform() when run in an
  environment where neither: PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 nor PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE is set.
  This should fix platform tests which started failing when HOST_OS/HOST_ARCH changes
  introduced by Aaron Franke (listed below) were merged.

FIXES
-----

- Fix reproducible builds. Restore logic respecting SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH when set.
- Small fix to ensure CLVar default value is an empty list.
  See MongoDB bug report: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-59656
  Code contributed by MongoDB.
- Fix ninja tool to never use for_sig substitution because ninja does not use signatures. This
  issue affected CommandGeneratorAction function actions specifically.
- Fix PCH not being evaluated by subst() where necessary.
- Fix issue #4021.  Change the way subst() is used in Textfile() to not evaluate '$$(' -> '$',
  but instead it should yield '$('.
- Fix MSVS tests (vs-N.N-exec.py) for MSVS 6.0, 7.0, and 7.1 (import missing module).
- Fix command line escaping for ninja dollar sign escape. Without escaping ninja properly,
  the ninja file scons regenerate and callback invocations will lose the $ characters used in
  the scons command line which ninja uses itself for escaping. For Example:
      scons BUILD=xyz OTHERVAR=$BUILD
  Prior to this fix, it would cause ninja to fail to escape the dollar sign, leading to the 
  single dollar sign being used as a ninja escape character in the ninja file.

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- List improvements that wouldn't be visible to the user in the
  documentation:  performance improvements (describe the circumstances
  under which they would be observed), or major code cleanups

PACKAGING
---------

- List changes in the way SCons is packaged and/or released

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- List any significant changes to the documentation (not individual
  typo fixes, even if they're mentioned in src/CHANGES.txt to give
  the contributor credit)

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- Added --no-ignore-skips to runtest.py. Changed default to ignore skips when setting
  runtest.py's exit status. Previously would exit 2 if any tests were skipped.
  Now will only exit 2 if user specifies --no-ignore-skips and some tests were skipped.
