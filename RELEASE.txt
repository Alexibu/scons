on the SCons download page:

      https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.2.0:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- Added ninja API 'NINJA_FORCE_SCONS_BUILD' to force a node to callback to scons.

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- Further PCH updates. It's now recommended that env['PCH'] should always be a File node.
  Either via return value from env.PCH() or by explicitly using File('StdAfx.pch').
- Change SCons.Platform.win32.get_architecture() to return platform.platform() when run in an
  environment where neither: PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 nor PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE is set.
  This should fix platform tests which started failing when HOST_OS/HOST_ARCH changes
  introduced by Aaron Franke (listed below) were merged.

FIXES
-----

- Fix reproducible builds. Restore logic respecting SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH when set.
- Small fix to ensure CLVar default value is an empty list.
  See MongoDB bug report: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-59656
  Code contributed by MongoDB.
- Fix ninja tool to never use for_sig substitution because ninja does not use signatures. This
  issue affected CommandGeneratorAction function actions specifically.
- Fix PCH not being evaluated by subst() where necessary.
- Fix issue #4021.  Change the way subst() is used in Textfile() to not evaluate '$$(' -> '$',
  but instead it should yield '$('.

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- List improvements that wouldn't be visible to the user in the
  documentation:  performance improvements (describe the circumstances
  under which they would be observed), or major code cleanups

PACKAGING
---------

- List changes in the way SCons is packaged and/or released

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- List any significant changes to the documentation (not individual
  typo fixes, even if they're mentioned in src/CHANGES.txt to give
