Add a function which validates required args:

def validate(required, **kwargs):
    """check that all the tags in required are present in kwargs."""
    diff = required - set(kwargs.keys())
    if diff:
        # set should be empty if all required in kwargs
        # do some sort of error handling: bail?
        return False
    return True


Intended to simplify function sigs which currently look like this:

def package(env, target, source, PACKAGEROOT, NAME, VERSION,
            PACKAGEVERSION, DESCRIPTION, SUMMARY, X_RPM_GROUP, LICENSE,
            **kw):
